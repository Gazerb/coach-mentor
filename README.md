Clitheroe Wolves Coach Mentoring system is something that Clitheore Wolves FC will use with their new coaches in order for them to get the help and support they need from experienced coaches within the club. This is my third milestone project for the full stack development course at Code Institute / City of Bristol College. For this project I had to create a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain. This was to include the use of Flask framework.
